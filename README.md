# RAASS (rogue autonomous aerial surveillance system) 
These days it is hard to imagine life without telecommunications. Anyone who uses e-banking, online payment, online shopping, e-government are long used to one time passwords for transaction confirmation. The security of this authentication method is based merely on restricting access to telecommunication networks. While the internet of things is spreading widely into industrial processes and city infrastructure, failures in the mobile network can paralyze them, causing not only occasional interruptions in smart home or car devices, which dissatisfied the operatorâ€™s customers, but also more critical consequences, such as traffic collapses or power outages.
Today the signaling network is not isolated, and this allows an intruder to exploit its flaws and intercept calls and SMSs, bypass billing, steal money from mobile accounts, or affect mobile network operability.
This project will exploit the vulnerabilities in the GSM network, we will be  building a vendor independent gsm bts(base transceiver station) which can be used to create a private network or GSM active tapping/interception/hijacking with the help of off the shelf networking hardware.

Our project is integrated with a tailored autonomous smart drone that will have the ability to sniff packets with discretion and reach places that are hard to reach.

This project is for educational purposes only.
